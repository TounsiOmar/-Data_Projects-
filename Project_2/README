- Built worksheets analyzing different views on return rates
- Joined multiple tables within Tableau 
- Created calculated fields to based on existing columns to clean data and make it usable
- Dashboard:
  - Scatterplot showing correlation between total sales and total returns. Aggregated by product subcategory
  - Calculated total returns and return rate KPI metrics
  - Return Rates by States
  - Return Rate by Month
  - Return Rate by Week Day for Region
  - Return Rate by Week Day for Ship Mode
  - Created universal filters to filter all charts by Ship Mode, Weekday, and Region

Analysis:
Returns are measured by the total number of returns over the total number of orders. I believe that there is no 
regional significance as to why return rates are higher - geographically, the return rates are very similar. There may be 
more investigation to do based on shipping modes of products. Especially on Thursday and Friday, Same-Day Shipping skyrockets from 
the average return rate of 25% to around 75% these days. Similarly, the months of August and September seem to experience the highest 
return rates and, on average, Mondays experience a high return rate from the Eastern Region while Fridays experience a high return rate for the Western Region. 


Conclusions
There is a geographical difference in return rates by customers, especially in the western and eastern regions. 
I created another dashboard that removes any unnecessary metrics and have included filters for Ship Modes as this seems to be a problem aswell. 

Recommendations
There needs to be further analysis and communication to investigate shipping modes. 
A feedback form for customers with repeat returns and every repeat customer may be necessary to gather insights.
