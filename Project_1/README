- I built a Google Sheets report to answer the following business questions:
    - Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
    - How much money did these listings generate?

- This project solidified my Excel/Sheets skills in the following areas:
    - Data cleaning tools, like text functions and Find and Replace
    - Pivot tables for quick and efficient analyses
    - Spreadsheet best practices, like adding documentation and protecting sheets
    - Building charts and graphs using the chart editor
